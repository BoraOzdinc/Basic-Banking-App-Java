# Basic Banking App in Java
  This application was made as Object-oriented programming final project in software engineering.
  I used Apache NetBeans IDE 16 as IDE and JFrame for gui.
## What can it do? 
  Well, the app can register person and save all the persons into folder, keep track of individual persons account up to four accounts per person and all of their transactions.
  The app gives you 6 digit account number for logging in and you have to use the same account number for logging in or receiving money.
  if you fotget your account number the app will let you have it with your name and password.
